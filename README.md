Title: Computational Docking Analysis of Petroselinum crispum Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase for Myristicin Biotransformation  
Abstract: Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) from Anabaena flos-aquae has been identified as a novel biocatalyst for myristicin biotransformation, producing compounds with potential pharmacological applications. This study extends these findings by employing computational molecular docking to investigate the substrate specificity and binding interactions of PAL from parsley (Petroselinum crispum, PDB ID: 1W27), demonstrating the efficacy of plant-derived enzymes. Using AutoDock Vina, the parsley PAL was docked with ligands including phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, myristicin, and elemicin, following structural preparation with PDBFixer, pdb2pqr, and Open Babel. Docking was performed at pH 8.0, targeting the enzyme’s active site (residues 110, 134, 136, 488), with binding affinities calculated to assess catalytic potential. Interactive 3D visualizations generated with py3Dmol revealed favorable binding poses within a hydrophobic pocket, consistent with the enzyme’s mechanism for nucleophilic attack and ammonia uptake. Results indicate myristicin’s high binding affinity, supporting its biotransformation potential. This open-source pipeline, implemented in Google Colab, provides a scalable framework for enzyme-ligand interaction studies, with applications in drug synthesis, biofuel production, and environmental deamination. The code and visualizations are freely available on GitHub, fostering collaborative advancements in plant and algal biotechnology.

Snippet mentions a PAL mutant Y110F that showed a very significant loss of activity, indicating that Tyrosine at position 110 is crucial for catalysis or substrate binding in PAL.
Snippet  refers to Tyr110 as an analogous residue in parsley PAL (PcPAL, which corresponds to 1W27) and mentions its location near the substrate entrance channel to the MIO group, which is the catalytic center of PAL.   
Snippet  explicitly lists Tyr110 (UniProt numbering) as a catalytic residue in PDB entry 1w27, noting its role in making ammonia a better leaving group. It also mentions Asp351 (corresponding to your 349 in PDB numbering, so likely related to your 348 or 349) as deprotonating the substrate. While your list doesn't have 349/351, it's in the vicinity.   
Snippet  also mentions other essential residues determined by mutagenesis, such as His83, Arg283, Met382, Tyr53, Tyr280, Asn195, and Glu414 (using the numbering from a related enzyme, PpHAL). While these numbers don't directly match yours, they highlight that the active site involves multiple key residues.   
Snippet  mentions Lys486 as being located on the active site helices and contributing to MIO cofactor stabilization. This is close to your residue 488.   

Cofactor: MIO is a crucial cofactor involved in the catalytic reaction of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL).
Electrophilic Nature: It's a highly electrophilic moiety that sits in the active site of PAL.  This electrophilicity is enhanced by its location atop the positive pole of three polar helices in the active site.    
Formation: MIO is formed autocatalytically within the enzyme from a conserved Ala-Ser-Gly tripeptide segment through cyclization and dehydration.    
Mechanism: In the catalytic mechanism, the aromatic ring of L-phenylalanine attacks the MIO, activating the C-H bond for deprotonation.  The MIO then facilitates the elimination of ammonia.    
Active Site Component: The active site of PAL contains the MIO group, which is non-covalently bonded to three helices.  Specific residues like Leu266, Asn270, Val269, Leu215, Lys486, and Ile472 are located on these active site helices and Phe413, Glu496, and Gln500 contribute to its stabilization.    
Comparison to other enzymes: MIO is also found in other ammonia lyases like histidine ammonia-lyase (HAL) and aminomutases.   
In essence, the MIO group is the essential chemical component within the active site of PAL that directly participates in the deamination reaction of phenylalanine (and potentially other substrates like myristicin).

Now the above is part one, focusing mostly on forward action, however the amination reaction is a reverse reaction. I will provide a part two soon visualizing that. Difficulties involve the inclusion of both ammonia and phenylpropanoid at active sites which was not difficult however getting proper optimiztion here involving a chimerac like dual mechanism was more difficult. Many tools such as active-site could make this easier, if I had ubuntu installed I could do it in 5 minutes, the packages are very difficult to install in google colab, and I installed many just in this example that are notiourlsly difficult aka MGLTOOLS etc... part two abstrat below:




Reverse Hydroamination of Myristicin by Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase: Mechanism and Residues Involved
1. Introduction:

Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase (PAL), classified under Enzyme Commission number EC 4.3.1.24, stands as a pivotal enzyme in the metabolic landscape of plants, fungi, and certain bacteria. Its primary function is to catalyze the non-oxidative deamination of the amino acid L-phenylalanine into trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia. This enzymatic transformation marks a critical branch point in the phenylpropanoid pathway, leading to the biosynthesis of a diverse array of secondary metabolites essential for various biological functions. While the forward reaction of PAL is extensively studied, its reverse activity, particularly with non-canonical substrates, remains an area of ongoing investigation. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the reverse reaction of PAL, focusing on the hydroamination of myristicin, a naturally occurring phenylpropene. The discussion will delve into the proposed mechanism of this reverse reaction and identify the amino acid residues within the PAL active site that are likely involved in facilitating this transformation. Understanding this enzymatic capability could potentially broaden the application of PAL in biocatalytic synthesis, especially for the production of valuable compounds relevant to the pharmaceutical industry.

2. Understanding the Catalytic Mechanism of PAL:

The catalytic prowess of PAL is intricately linked to its unique active site and the chemical transformations it facilitates. The enzyme catalyzes a reversible reaction, and understanding both the forward and reverse mechanisms is crucial for comprehending its interaction with substrates like myristicin.

Forward Reaction (Deamination): The well-established forward reaction of PAL involves the stereospecific removal of an ammonia molecule from L-phenylalanine, yielding trans-cinnamic acid. This non-oxidative deamination is mediated by a distinctive prosthetic group located within the active site: the 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO). The MIO is generated through an autocatalytic process involving the cyclization and dehydration of a highly conserved Ala-Ser-Gly tripeptide sequence within the PAL enzyme. The generally accepted mechanism for the forward reaction is an E1cB-like elimination. In this mechanism, the MIO acts as an electrophile, initiating the reaction by interacting with the substrate. This interaction facilitates the abstraction of a proton from the β-carbon of L-phenylalanine by a basic residue in the active site, leading to the formation of a carbanion intermediate. Subsequently, the amino group is eliminated, and the double bond is formed, resulting in trans-cinnamic acid.   

Enzymatic Reversibility: Like many enzymes, PAL can catalyze the reverse of its primary reaction under appropriate conditions. In the case of PAL, the reverse reaction involves the hydroamination of trans-cinnamic acid with ammonia to produce L-phenylalanine. This reverse activity has been exploited for the industrial production of optically pure L-phenylalanine, a crucial precursor in the synthesis of the artificial sweetener aspartame. The mechanism of the reverse reaction is thought to be the reverse of the forward reaction, involving the nucleophilic attack of ammonia on the double bond of trans-cinnamic acid. This step is facilitated by the MIO cofactor and specific amino acid residues within the active site, which likely participate in proton transfer and stabilization of reaction intermediates. Driving the equilibrium towards the formation of L-phenylalanine typically requires a high concentration of ammonia in the reaction mixture. The ability of PAL to catalyze both the elimination and addition of ammonia across a double bond underscores the adaptability of its active site to accommodate different substrates and reaction conditions.   

3. Myristicin as a Potential Substrate for PAL's Reverse Reaction:

Myristicin, a naturally occurring compound found in various spices and herbs, presents an interesting case for exploring the substrate specificity of PAL's reverse reaction. Its structural features offer clues about its potential interaction with the enzyme's active site.

Introduction to Myristicin: Myristicin, chemically known as 1-allyl-5-methoxy-3,4-methylenedioxybenzene, is a phenylpropene derivative that is a significant component of nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) oil and is also found in smaller quantities in parsley, dill, and other plants. Its chemical structure includes an allyl group (a three-carbon chain with a terminal double bond) and a methylenedioxy ring fused to the benzene ring, along with a methoxy substituent.

Structural Comparison: Myristicin, with its allyl side chain, possesses an α,β-unsaturated system similar to that found in trans-cinnamic acid, which is a known substrate for the reverse reaction of PAL. However, the presence of the methoxy and methylenedioxy groups on the aromatic ring of myristicin distinguishes it structurally from the simpler cinnamic acid. These substituents could potentially influence how myristicin interacts with the active site of PAL, affecting both binding affinity and the subsequent catalytic steps.   

Evidence of Biotransformation: Research has demonstrated that PAL from algal sources, specifically Anabaena flos-aquae and Spirulina platensis, can catalyze the hydroamination of myristicin, resulting in the formation of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine. The reported enzymatic yield of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine was 10.6% for PAL from A. flos-aquae and 15.3% for PAL from S. platensis. This finding is significant as it indicates that PAL, particularly from algal sources, exhibits a broader substrate tolerance for the reverse hydroamination reaction than previously recognized, capable of acting on molecules with modifications to the aromatic ring. This suggests that the methoxy and methylenedioxy groups on myristicin do not necessarily hinder its interaction with the PAL active site and might even be accommodated by specific interactions with amino acid residues.   

4. Identification of Likely Involved Residues in PAL's Active Site:

The active site of PAL is a highly specialized microenvironment where the catalytic transformation of substrates occurs. Understanding its architecture and the roles of specific amino acid residues is essential for elucidating the mechanism of myristicin hydroamination.

General Active Site Architecture: The active site of PAL is characterized by the presence of the electrophilic MIO cofactor, which is crucial for both the deamination and hydroamination reactions. This cofactor resides within a narrow tunnel formed by the protein structure. The active site also includes a substrate-binding pocket that is shaped to accommodate the specific substrate, whether it is L-phenylalanine for the forward reaction or an α,β-unsaturated acid like cinnamic acid for the reverse reaction.   

Conserved Active Site Residues: Several amino acid residues within the PAL active site are highly conserved across different species and are critical for the catalytic mechanism. In Petroselinum crispum PAL (parsley PAL), which has been extensively studied, residues such as Tyr110 and Tyr351 (using the numbering from PDB code 1W27 ) are believed to play essential roles in proton transfer steps during the catalytic cycle. Studies involving site-directed mutagenesis of these residues in P. crispum PAL have demonstrated significant reductions in enzyme activity, underscoring their importance. It is highly probable that the corresponding residues in algal PALs (Anabaena flos-aquae and Spirulina platensis) would also participate in similar proton transfer steps during the reverse hydroamination of myristicin.   

Potential Residues for Myristicin Binding: The substrate-binding pocket of PAL contains amino acid residues that are responsible for recognizing and binding the substrate. In P. crispum PAL, residues such as F137, L134, L206, L256, and I460 have been identified as crucial determinants of substrate specificity, particularly in accommodating various substituents on the aromatic ring of phenylalanine and cinnamic acid analogs. Similar residues in the active sites of algal PALs would likely be involved in interacting with the aromatic ring and the unique functional groups of myristicin, namely the allyl, methoxy, and methylenedioxy groups. Hydrophobic residues within the binding pocket would likely interact with the nonpolar portions of myristicin, such as the allyl group and the aromatic ring. Polar residues could potentially form hydrogen bonds with the methoxy group, contributing to the specific binding orientation of myristicin within the active site.   

Differences Between Plant and Algal PALs: While the overall three-dimensional structure and the presence of the MIO cofactor are conserved across PALs from different sources, algal PALs are generally smaller in size compared to plant PALs. Furthermore, algal PALs, such as those from Anabaena flos-aquae and Spirulina platensis, have been reported to exhibit a broader substrate specificity compared to many plant PALs. This difference in substrate specificity could be attributed to variations in the amino acid residues that constitute the active site and the substrate-binding pocket. For instance, the conformation and flexibility of the active site loop might differ between plant and algal PALs, potentially affecting the accessibility and binding of substrates like myristicin. The specific amino acid residues lining the hydrophobic binding pocket are also likely to vary, and these variations could enable algal PALs to better accommodate the unique structural features of myristicin, including its allyl group and the aromatic ring substituents, compared to some plant PALs.   

Insight: The reverse hydroamination of myristicin by PAL likely relies on the same core catalytic machinery involving the MIO cofactor and conserved proton transfer residues that are utilized in the canonical reverse reaction with cinnamic acid. However, the substrate specificity for myristicin, leading to its successful conversion to 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine by algal PALs, is likely determined by the specific amino acid residues within the active site's binding pocket that can effectively interact with the unique structural elements of myristicin. The differences in substrate specificity observed between plant and algal PALs might stem from subtle variations in the amino acid composition and architecture of their respective active sites.

5. Proposed Mechanism of Myristicin Hydroamination by PAL:

Based on the general understanding of PAL's reverse reaction and the structural characteristics of myristicin, a plausible mechanism for its hydroamination can be proposed.

Binding of Myristicin: The initial step would involve the binding of myristicin to the active site of PAL. It is likely that myristicin would orient its allyl group in proximity to the MIO cofactor, similar to how trans-cinnamic acid binds during the reverse reaction. The methoxy and methylenedioxy substituents on the aromatic ring would interact with specific amino acid residues within the binding pocket, potentially through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and weak polar interactions, contributing to the substrate's specific orientation.   

Nucleophilic Attack by Ammonia: In the presence of a high concentration of ammonia, a nucleophilic attack by an ammonia molecule would occur at the β-carbon of the allyl group's double bond in myristicin. This step is likely facilitated by the MIO cofactor, which could activate the double bond towards nucleophilic addition. Active site residues, such as Tyr351 (using the P. crispum numbering as a reference), might play a role by acting as a general acid or base, assisting in the protonation state of the ammonia or the substrate.

Formation of a Carbanion Intermediate: The nucleophilic attack of ammonia on the double bond would result in the formation of a transient carbanion intermediate. This intermediate would likely be stabilized by interactions with positively charged or polar amino acid residues located within the active site. These interactions would help to position the intermediate for the subsequent protonation step.

Protonation to Form 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine: A proton from a nearby active site residue, such as Tyr110, would then be transferred to the carbanion intermediate. The regioselectivity and stereochemistry of this protonation step would determine the structure and chirality of the product, 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine. Given the known stereospecificity of PAL in its reverse reaction with cinnamic acid, it is probable that the hydroamination of myristicin would also exhibit stereospecificity, yielding a particular enantiomer of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine.

Release of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine: Finally, the newly formed 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine molecule would dissociate from the active site of the enzyme, allowing the PAL enzyme to catalyze another round of the reaction.

Insight: This proposed mechanism aligns with the general understanding of PAL's reverse hydroamination activity and takes into account the structural features of myristicin. The stereospecificity observed with other substrates suggests that the hydroamination of myristicin would likely yield a specific enantiomer of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine, although further research would be necessary to definitively determine the stereochemical outcome.

6. Comparison with Known PAL Reverse Reactions:

The reverse hydroamination of myristicin by PAL shares some fundamental characteristics with the established reverse reaction of PAL on trans-cinnamic acid, but also exhibits notable differences that likely arise from the unique structural features of myristicin.

Similarities: Both reactions necessitate a high concentration of ammonia to shift the equilibrium towards product formation and involve the MIO cofactor as a key catalytic component. Furthermore, it is highly probable that conserved active site residues, such as those involved in proton transfer, participate in both transformations.   

Differences: The structural distinctions between myristicin and trans-cinnamic acid, particularly the presence of the allyl group and the methoxy and methylenedioxy substituents on the aromatic ring of myristicin, likely lead to variations in substrate binding and orientation within the PAL active site. These substituents could establish specific interactions with residues in the binding pocket that are not involved in the interaction with the simpler cinnamic acid molecule. Additionally, the electronic properties of the allyl group and the aromatic ring of myristicin, which are influenced by the attached substituents, might affect the rate of the nucleophilic attack by ammonia compared to the unsubstituted cinnamic acid. The reported lower enzymatic yield of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine from myristicin when compared to the yield of L-phenylalanine from cinnamic acid under similar conditions  could be indicative of these differences in binding affinity, substrate orientation, and inherent reactivity within the enzyme's active site.   

Insight: While the core chemical transformation catalyzed by PAL in its reverse mode might be similar for both myristicin and trans-cinnamic acid, the specific substrate-enzyme interactions, dictated by the unique structural attributes of myristicin, likely result in variations in the efficiency, kinetics, and potentially the detailed steps of the hydroamination reaction. These differences highlight the importance of the substrate's precise structure in determining its suitability for a particular enzymatic transformation.

7. Conclusion and Future Directions:

The research indicates that Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase, particularly from algal sources like Anabaena flos-aquae and Spirulina platensis, possesses the capability to catalyze the reverse hydroamination reaction on myristicin, yielding 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyisopropylamine. This finding expands our understanding of PAL's substrate specificity and its potential in biocatalytic synthesis. The proposed mechanism for this transformation likely involves the binding of myristicin within the active site, a nucleophilic attack by ammonia facilitated by the MIO cofactor, and proton transfer steps mediated by conserved active site residues. However, the unique structural features of myristicin compared to the canonical reverse substrate, trans-cinnamic acid, likely lead to differences in the efficiency and specific interactions within the enzyme's active site.

To further elucidate the mechanism of myristicin hydroamination by PAL and to potentially optimize this biocatalytic process, several avenues of future research can be pursued:

Molecular Docking Studies: Computational modeling techniques such as molecular docking should be employed to visualize the interaction of myristicin with the active sites of various PAL enzymes, including both plant and algal sources. These studies could help predict the preferred binding modes of myristicin and identify specific amino acid residues that are likely to interact with the substrate's allyl group and aromatic ring substituents.   

Site-Directed Mutagenesis: To experimentally validate the roles of specific amino acid residues in myristicin hydroamination, site-directed mutagenesis studies should be conducted on PAL genes, targeting residues predicted by docking studies or known to be important in substrate binding and catalysis in other PALs. The effect of these mutations on the enzyme's ability to hydroaminate myristicin can then be assessed through activity assays.   

Kinetic Analyses: Detailed kinetic studies are necessary to determine the Michaelis constant (K<sub>m</sub>) and the catalytic rate constant (k<sub>cat</sub>) for the hydroamination of myristicin by purified PAL enzymes from different sources. Comparing these kinetic parameters with those obtained for the reverse reaction using cinnamic acid as a substrate could provide valuable insights into the enzyme's affinity and efficiency for myristicin.   

Structural Studies: If technically feasible, attempts should be made to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional structures of PAL in complex with myristicin or substrate analogs using techniques such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. Such structural information would provide a direct visualization of the substrate binding mode and the specific interactions occurring at the atomic level.   

Comparative Enzymology: Further research should explore the activity of PAL enzymes from a broader range of organisms, including plants, algae, bacteria, and fungi, towards myristicin. This comparative approach could identify PAL enzymes that exhibit naturally higher catalytic efficiency for the hydroamination of this specific substrate.   

outlines/questions:
1) Immense potential for greatly increasing rate of lignin/cellulose/starch synthesis with no genetic modification invovled via indirect mechanisms
2) In many enviromental configuratins ammonia (particularly excess ammonia) is undesirable, dual strategies can yield valuable compounds while cleaning enviroment
3) Many pharmacuticals can be biosynthesized, We wont cover that here but one aspect is that reactions that synthetically are very sterically unfavorable, are now absolutely favorable. Also elimination of multiple steps into a single step is profound
4) semi-synthesis potential, the pocket has space for more. Ammonia/nh3 is very small molecule, customized amines / extended alkyls ARE POSSABLE, once again something that involves multiple steps can now be done in single step
5) biotechnology: 1 kg of plant material only yields so many micrograms of enzyme, crude extracts may still be active. faculatively aerobic conditions brings us to fermentation like routes, where spoilage can be inhibited at proper ph/temp/nutrients etc
